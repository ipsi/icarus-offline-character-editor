# Icarus Offline Character Editor
Basic GUI editor for *offline* characters for the game Icarus: First Cohort
([Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/))

## Installation
Look for the [latest release](https://github.com/ipsi/icarus-offline-character-editor/releases)
and download the file ` icarus-offline-character-editor-v0.0.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz`.
Decompress the archive and extract the file ` icarus-offline-character-editor.exe` somewhere, then
run it. The application will start 

## Usage
Run the program.

Make changes to your character. Not all functions are implemented yet.

Click save to save changes. Clicking any save button saves changes to
_all_ characters and to your global profile.

### Unfinished Pieces
"Unlock All Prospects" and "Unlock All Blueprints" do not, in fact,
unlock all of either of these things at the moment.

Checking "Exotic Extraction Unlocked" does not currently work, though
the mining one should.

## WARNING
This could destroy any or all of your offline data. It is _strongly_
recommended that you backup the folder `%APPDATA\Local\Icarus\Saved\Offline`
before using this tool.
