([Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/))

## Installation
Not setup yet. When done, will be "download exe and run"

## Usage
Run the program. If it fails to start, then it likely had issues finding
your Icarus data, and you should run from the command line to get the log
messages.

Make changes to your character. Not all functions are implemented yet.

Click save to save changes.

## WARNING
This could destroy any or all of your offline data. It is _strongly_
recommended that you backup the folder `%APPDATA\Local\Icarus\Saved\Offline`
before using this tool.
