Some stuff

## Installation
There are two versions of the program provided - one will allow you to restore dead/abandoned
characters, unlock all prospects, and reset your Talents and Blueprints. The other provides a
more comprehensive set of functionality, allowing you to set your credits, exotics, unlock
workshop items, set the XP of your character, unlock _all_ talents (more than is normally possible),
and so on. Compare the two versions:

Minimal Version:
